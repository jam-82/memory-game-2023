//.sort(()=>0.5-Math.random())

you're returning a random positive or negative number when you compare every two elements in turn, and JS will sort randomly. Each comparison is either positive or negative (very occasionally it will be 0 as well), so it will not be just ascending or descending most of the time, it will be random.

Math.random returns a random number between 0 and 1. So if it happens to give you a number less than 0.5 then you get a negative number and if it's over 0.5 then you get a positive number


If compareFunction(a,b) is less than 0, sort a to lower index than b. (ascending)
i.e. a comes first 

If compareFunction(a,b) returns 0, leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other.

If compareFunction(a,b) is greater than 0, sort b to lower index than a.  (descending)
i.e  b comes first

// we only want to get two items in the cardsChosen array and compare the two and if the two don't match, we want clear the cardsChosen array and start again

If there are 2 items in our cardsChosen array,
with the method setTimeout we invoke a function after a certain amount of time is passed, 
I wanna check if the two cards match, if they match take them off the board and if they don't match flipped them back over
